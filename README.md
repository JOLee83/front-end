Quicklee is full stack web app built for my capstone project from my time at sdg.
The front-end is built with React.js and SASS, the back end is an web API built with C#, .Net, Linq, and Entity framework.
You can find the app on Surge at quicklee.surge.sh, the back end is hosted on Heroku. 
Note: If the app hasn't been used in more than 30 minutes the API will take some time for the first response.
